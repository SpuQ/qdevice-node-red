# Qdevice Node-RED
Node-RED node for communication with Qcom-based hardware modules.

## Install Node (cli)
To use this node, go to your Node-RED folder and install the node
```
cd ~/.node-red/
npm install @spuq/qdevice-node-red
```
**Note:** This node requires the Qcom device driver, which is installed
with this package's dependency 'qdevice'. You might have to install the
Qcom driver manually as root.
